This is an overview of the assignment, so that you can read it and get an idea.
After reading this, go on to read the READMEpa2 file.

1 Assignment Overview

1.1 The Actual Game

In lecture 2, we learned about the emacs text editor. We also learned the
bizarre fact that emacs has some built in games. One of these is a text-based
adventure game. We will be recreating a portion of that game, as a way of
reinforcing what we have learned about UNIX in lectures 1&2. I will now give
some details about how to run the specific part of the game that we will be
recreating. But these details are only for your reference -- you will not
need to play the game in order to do the assignment, because I will describe
what precisely you are supposed to do, here in this document.

To begin, if you want to run the game, you open emacs. The game can be run
under the menu choice: alt-` -> tools -> games -> Adventure.
Nonetheless, the game's own help page says that it is not intended to be run
in this way. Instead it is meant to be run by typing: "emacs -batch -l dunnet"

Let's try that:

% emacs -batch -l dunnet
Dead end
You are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.
In the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The
trees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant
from each other.
There is a shovel here.
>


Above, we see the start of the game. The prompt has become a ">", indicating
that you are inside the game. We can type a command now. For example, we could
type "get shovel" or we could type "e", since the text says the road goes east.

But we won't type those commands, instead we'll restore a saved file, called
"cave", that I have provided to you in the same posting as this README file:

% emacs -batch -l dunnet
Dead end
You are at a dead end of a dirt road.  The road goes to the east.
In the distance you can see that it will eventually fork off.  The
trees here are very tall royal palms, and they are spaced equidistant
from each other.
There is a shovel here.
>restore cave
Done.
Misty Room
There is a gold bar here.
>


Above, we see that restoring the cave file has advanced us to a later part of
the game (the third level: the level that is in a cave). The reason that we
have advanced to this point is that this third level is what we will be
attempting to recreate. Let's continue to play the game for a bit:

>restore cave
Done.
Misty Room
There is a gold bar here.
>look
Misty Room
You are in a misty, humid room carved into a mountain.
To the north is the remains of a rockslide.  To the east, a small
passage leads away into the darkness.
There is a gold bar here.
>n
You can't go that way.
>e
Cave E/W passage
You are in an east/west passageway.  The walls here are made of
multicolored rock and are quite beautiful.
>w
Misty Room
There is a gold bar here.
>e
Cave E/W passage
>look
Cave E/W passage
You are in an east/west passageway.  The walls here are made of
multicolored rock and are quite beautiful.
>

Above, we observe a few things:
 - The first time that you enter a room, you get a full description. But,
   after that, if you ever reenter the room, you only get the first line of
   the description.
 - The full description can still be redisplayed, if you type "look".
 - There are also objects in some rooms. A gold bar, in this case. These
   objects are also displayed when you enter the room or "look".
 - The structure of these rooms is familiar to us from assignment #1. Recall
   that assignment: The base directory had a subdirectory called "e". And
   that subdirectory had two subdirectories of its own: "n" and "w". And so on.
   Now notice the structure above: the first room (Misty) has a room to the
   east (Cave) with a room to its east (N/S/W Junction). This junction has 3
   exits, but one of them is backtracking. So that leaves 2 forward exits,
   north and south. In other words, the structure of the directories that you
   built in the last assignment was designed based on this game.


Let's continue to play the game again:

>restore cave
Done.
Misty Room
There is a gold bar here.
>i
You currently have:
A lamp
A life preserver
A diamond
A slip of paper
A floppy disk
A shovel
A brass key
A bracelet
>get all
A gold bar: Taken.
>look
Misty Room
You are in a misty, humid room carved into a mountain.
To the north is the remains of a rockslide.  To the east, a small
passage leads away into the darkness.
>i
You currently have:
A lamp
A life preserver
A diamond
A slip of paper
A floppy disk
A shovel
A brass key
A bracelet
A gold bar
>

Above, we see that the game has an "i" command to show the "inventory" of
items that the player currently holds. We also see that the player enters
level 3 of this game already holding a variety of items that were picked up
in the earlier levels (i.e., I picked them up when I played the first 2 levels,
before I saved the "cave" file).
We also see that you can "get" objects. And the gold bar, once picked up, will:
1) disappear from the room, and 2) appear in your inventory.


1.2 Our version of the game

OK. That's enough of the actual game. For this assignment we are going to
implement a simplified version. (If you think about it, it is pretty surprising
that we can implement anything at all -- we don't know how to do make variables
or loops yet.)

Our main simplification is that we can only type single-word commands. In the
above walkthrough of the actual game, we had typed "get all", but that is two
words. So we will instead type "getall". Another simplification is that we will
only implement a few commands:n,s,w,e,ne,nw,se,sw,u,d,i,getall,look,sleep,dig.

Let's try it:
% source B000000000.pa2
% game
Misty Room
You are in a misty, humid room carved into a mountain.
To the north is the remains of a rockslide.  To the east, a small
passage leads away into the darkness.
Here there is:
A gold bar
>


Notice from the above, that:
- Your homework file is named with your student ID number, followed by ".pa2"
- You use the source command to run your file (see slide #62 of Lecture 2's
  Powerpoint).
- Your file must have defined an alias for "game", because typing that command
  has put us into the game. The room displays and the prompt changes to ">"
- The full room description does, in fact display (in the earlier actual game,
  the first room didn't display, because we restored a save file.)

Alright, let's keep going:
% game
Misty Room
You are in a misty, humid room carved into a mountain.
To the north is the remains of a rockslide.  To the east, a small
passage leads away into the darkness.
Here there is:
A gold bar
>i
You currently have:
A bracelet
A diamond
A floppy disk
A brass key
A slip of paper
A life preserver
A shovel
>getall
You pick things up.
>i
You currently have:
A bracelet
A diamond
A floppy disk
A gold bar
A brass key
A slip of paper
A life preserver
A shovel
>look
Misty Room
You are in a misty, humid room carved into a mountain.
To the north is the remains of a rockslide.  To the east, a small
passage leads away into the darkness.
>getall
There is nothing here to get.
>


Notice from the above, that:
- The i command works. (The order of the display is unimportant.
- The getall command properly picks up the gold: it goes into the inventory
  and disappears from the room.
- The getall command properly complains when there is nothing to pick up.


Alright, let's keep going some more:
% game
Misty Room
You are in a misty, humid room carved into a mountain.
To the north is the remains of a rockslide.  To the east, a small
passage leads away into the darkness.
Here there is:
A gold bar
>e
Cave E/W passage
You are in an east/west passageway.  The walls here are made of
multicolored rock and are quite beautiful.
>e
N/S/W Junction
You are at the junction of two passages. One goes north/south, and
the other goes west.
>w
Cave E/W passage
>w
Misty Room
Here there is:
A gold bar
> getall
You pick things up.
>e
Cave E/W passage
>u
You cannot go that way.
>w
Misty Room


Notice from the above, that:
- The full description of the room only displays the first time you enter the
  room (just like the real game).
- The short description also includes the statement that the gold bar is
  present (just like the real game).
- When you try to move in a wrong direction, you get an error message.
- The error message does not use any contractions: it says cannot, not can't.
  (This is important to note, because your program won't work right if you
  try to use contractions in your strings.)


Alright, let's keep going some more:
% game

You are in a misty, humid room carved into a mountain.
To the north is the remains of a rockslide.  To the east, a small

>cd e/e
>ls

>


Notice from the above, that:
- We are not really playing a game. Instead we have just added aliases for the
  game commands. To repeat: we've ADDED aliases. We haven't REMOVED anything.
  So the regular UNIX command like cd still work. (I mean that cd "works" in
  sense that it does change the directory. In so far as the game is concerned,
  this is not how thing are supposed to "work". Well, that just means that you
  are not supposed type UNIX commands.)
- The parent directory of the "Cave E/W passage" is the room with the gold bar.
  We see this because there is a file called "gold" in that directory.
- That parent directory also contains a subdirectory called "e". This is the
  directory of the "Cave E/W passage".
- That parent directory also contains a file called "contents". When we use
  cat to look inside that file, we see that it is the description of the room.
- That parent directory also contains a file called "1". This file is the way
  that we determine whether a room has been visited before:
   - A room with a "1" has been visited before, so only the 1st line of the
     contents file should be displayed.
   - A room with a "9" has not been visited before, so 9 lines of the contents
     file should be displayed. (None of the contents files of any rooms are
     longer that 9 lines, so the "9" effectively means to display all of the
     contents file. 
- The room that is two rooms east of the start is a room that we haven't
  visited yet, and it does indeed have a "9" instead of a "1".
- The room that is two rooms east of the start also has three subdirectories.



Alright, let's keep going some more:

N/S/W Junction
You are at the junction of two passages. One goes north/south, and

>s
South end of cave passage
You are at the south end of a north/south passageway.  There is a hole
in the floor here, into which you could probably fit.
d>d
Bathroom
You are in a bathroom built for workers in the cave.  There is a
urinal hanging on the wall, and some exposed pipes on the opposite
wall where a sink used to be.  To the north is a bedroom.
>n
Bedroom
You are in what appears to be a worker's bedroom.  There is a queen-
sized bed in the middle of the room, and a painting hanging on the
wall.  A door leads to another room to the south, and stairways
lead up and down.
>getall
You cannot pick that up.
>sleep
As soon as you start to doze off you begin dreaming.  You see images of
workers digging caves, slaving in the humid heat.  Then you see yourself
as one of these workers.  While no one is looking, you leave the group
and walk into a room.  The room is bare except for a horseshoe
shaped piece of stone in the center.  You see yourself digging a hole in
the ground, then putting some kind of treasure in it, and filling the hole
with dirt again.  After this, you immediately wake up.
>d
NE end of NE/SW cave passage
You are at the northeast end of a northeast/southwest passageway.
Stairs lead up out of sight.
>sleep
You try to sleep standing up, but cannot manage it.
>getall
There is nothing here to get.

Notice from the above, that:
- The sleep command gives an error message unless you are where the bed is
  (Figuring out to use the bed was one of the riddles in th game that will
  let you find the gold bar.)
- The getall command displays a different error message when in a room with
  things (a bed, a painting) that you can't get, than the error message that
  in a room without things (such as the room below the bedroom).
- If we do an "ls" inside of the bedroom, we can see that the bed and the
  painting are things in the room. (These things are represented by files, and
  these files contain descriptions of the objects -- although the displaying of
  these descriptions will not happen until the next homework.)
- There is also a hidden file in the bedroom. This file, .sleep, contains the
  description of the dream. (Since no other room will contain this file, we'll
  know that we are in the room where we can sleep. And since it is a hidden
  file, we won't think it is an object, in homework 3, when we xamine objects.)
  


Alright, let's keep going some more:
% game
Misty Room
You are in a misty, humid room carved into a mountain.
To the north is the remains of a rockslide.  To the east, a small
passage leads away into the darkness.
Here there is:
A gold bar
>cd e/e/s/d/n/d/sw/e/u

>cat contents
Horseshoe boulder room
You are in a room which is bare, except for a horseshoe shaped boulder
in the center.  Stairs lead down from here.
>ls
9  boulder  contents  horseshoe
>diff boulder horseshoe
>


Notice from the above, that:
- We can just jump directly to a room. (Not because it makes sense, from the
  point of view of the game, but because it makes it easier for us to get
  around, while talking about the game, in this README file.)
- The room that I have jumped to is the one with the horseshoe shaped boulder
  from the dream. This must mean that there is a treasure here.
- When I type "ls" I see the boulder, but I don't see the treasure. That is
  because it is not visible until we dig it up (as indicated in the dream).
- In fact, I see a "boulder" and a "horseshoe". This will become relevant in
  the next homework. But the idea is that the user might reasonably ask to
  look at either one. So they are the same (as indicated by the fact that
  "diff" produced no output).
- The room has a "9", even though we have entered it -- but only because we
  used cd to get to the room.

>getall
You pick things up.
>getall

>ls

Your digging reveals nothing.
>


Notice from the above, that:
- The treasure, a platinum bar, is actually in the room as a hidden file.
- Digging causes the treasure to no-longer be hidden.
- When I getall, I get the platinum, but not the boulder.
- Digging only works once, and only in this one room.




Alright, let's keep going some more:

>ls
9  bed  contents  d  painting  s  u
> pwd -P
/home/Me/pa2/start/e/e/n/d
>


Notice from the above, that:
- The pwd result is specific to my computer. Your output will not say "Me", for
  instance.
- There are two separate paths to get to the bedroom. The bed file can be
  accessed by either
  >cat /home/Me/pa2/start/e/e/n/d/bed       or
  >cat /home/Me/pa2/start/e/e/s/d/n/bed
- The -P flag causes ...../e/e/s/d/n to become  ...../e/e/n/d
  How to explain this? Well, there are a few places where paths merge in the
  game. Since we have used directories for the rooms, these merge points will
  need to be handled specially. Let's see how we do it:

Here there is:

You are at the south end of a north/south passageway.  There is a hole
in the floor here, into which you could probably fit.

>cd d
>pwd
/home/Me/pa2/start/e/e/s/d
>pwd -P
/home/Me/pa2/start/e/e/n/d/s
>


Notice from the above, that:
- The reason that we get a merge point is that there is a hole above the
  bathroom. You can drop down it, but you can't go back up.
- The merging is accomplished by creating a symbolic link.
- When following the symbolic link, the output of pwd indicates the symbolic
  path.
- If you want to see the physical path, you can use pwd's -P flag.

But there is a point about cd .. to discuss:


% game
Misty Room
You are in a misty, humid room carved into a mountain.
To the north is the remains of a rockslide.  To the east, a small
passage leads away into the darkness.
Here there is:
A gold bar
> cd e/e/s
> cd d
>pwd
/home/Me/pa2/start/e/e/s/d
cd ..
>pwd
/home/Me/pa2/start/e/e/s
>cd d
>pwd
/home/Me/pa2/start/e/e/s/d
> cd `pwd -P`
/home/Me/pa2/start/e/e/n/d/s
>cd ..
>pwd
/home/Me/pa2/start/e/e/n/d
>

Notice from the above, that:
- cd .. follows the link back to the symbolic parent.
- This is not what we want (after all, we got into the bathroom by jumping
  through a hole that we are not supposed to be able to climb back up.
- cd `pwd -P` changes the path to not have links. After executing this, the
  pwd without any flags gives the physical address -- and cd .. takes us to
  the bedroom rather than back through the hole (i.e., it works).
- The ` symbol is one that we have not learned yet. (You'll learn it in lecture
  3. But we can understand it easily enough: the output of pwd -P is converted
  into a command-line argument to the cd command (rather than printing to the
  screen).
  


We're almost done with describing the running of the game. The only things
left to say are that there are some other objects in other rooms, that there
are a few more symbolic links, and that there is a directory for the items we
hold. Let's see that directory:

% game
Misty Room
You are in a misty, humid room carved into a mountain.
To the north is the remains of a rockslide.  To the east, a small
passage leads away into the darkness.
Here there is:
A gold bar
>ls ../items
bracelet  contents  diamond  disk  floppy  key  life  paper  preserver  shovel
>

Among these items, the life preserver and the floppy disk are the most notable.
This is because they each have two names (analogous to how the horsesehoe
shaped boulder had two names). This double naming has no effect on this
homework, but will have an effect on homework 3.
