The urinal is very clean compared with everything else in the cave.  There
isn't even any rust.  Upon close examination you realize that the drain at the
bottom is missing, and there is just a large hole leading down the
pipes into nowhere.  The hole is too small for a person to fit in.  The
flush handle is so clean that you can see your reflection in it.
