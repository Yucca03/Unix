This file contains a walkthrough of our improved game. To begin, let's run the
game. (In this file, I use $ instead of my more-usual % for the unix prompt):

$ source pa3.sh
$ game
Misty Room
You are in a misty, humid room carved into a mountain.
To the north is the remains of a rockslide.  To the east, a small
passage leads away into the darkness.
Here there is:
A gold bar
>

So far, no difference from the previous programming assignment. But now we can
use objects (previously, none of our commands had objects. We even had to use
"getall" instead of "get all", just to get around the problem). So, let's look
at some objects:

> x gold
I see nothing special about that.
> i
You currently have:
A bracelet
A diamond
A floppy disk
A brass key
A slip of paper
A life preserver
A shovel
> x life
It says S. S. Minnow.
> x key
I see nothing special about that.
>

From the above, we see that we can examine objects that are either in my
inventory (the life preserver and the key) or in my current room (the gold).
The displayed text for these objects are the contents of their files.

Let's explore some more:
> e
Cave E/W passage
You are in an east/west passageway.  The walls here are made of
multicolored rock and are quite beautiful.
> x gold
I cannot see that here.
> x dfgdfgfdg
I cannot see that here.
> w
Misty Room
Here there is:
A gold bar
>

Here, we see that we cannot examine objects that are in other rooms. We also
can't see things that aren't objects (eg, dfgdfgfdg) -- the output in this case
is different from the original game, because the game would say that dfgdfgfdg
is not an object. Essentially, it works the same as the original game, however
(and I designed it this way just to make the assignment a little easier)

Now let's pick up and drop some objects:

> get gold
You pick up the gold
> drop life
Dropped.
> i
You currently have:
A bracelet
A diamond
A floppy disk
A gold bar
A brass key
A slip of paper
A shovel
> e
Cave E/W passage
> x gold
I see nothing special about that.
> w
Misty Room
Here there is:
A life preserver
> get preserver
You pick up the preserver
> drop gold
Dropped.
>

So, we see that we can drop and pick up objects. Note that two of the objects
(the floppy/drive and the life/preserver) need to be dropped as a pair. I mean,
if you move the floppy file but not the drive file (or visa-versa) then the
game will get confused about whether you have the object or not.

Let's explore a little more:
> e
Cave E/W passage
> w
Misty Room
> w
You cannot go that way.
> e
Cave E/W passage
> e
N/S/W Junction
You are at the junction of two passages. One goes north/south, and
the other goes west.
> n
North end of cave passage
You are at the north end of a north/south passageway.  There are stairs
leading down from here.  There is also a door leading west.
> w
You must type a 3 digit combination code to enter this room.
Enter it here: 123
Sorry, that combination is incorrect.
You cannot go that way.
> look
North end of cave passage
You are at the north end of a north/south passageway.  There are stairs
leading down from here.  There is also a door leading west.
>

Here, we see that the room at ~/pa3/start/e/e/n/w is "locked". This effect is
achieved by making the directory not executable. It looks like we're not going
to be able to get into this room unless we find the passcode. So, in the
meantime, let's key exploring:

> d
Bedroom
You are in what appears to be a worker's bedroom.  There is a queen-
sized bed in the middle of the room, and a painting hanging on the
wall.  A door leads to another room to the south, and stairways
lead up and down.
> x painting
It is a velvet painting of Elvis Presley.  It seems to be nailed to the
wall, and you cannot move it.
> get painting
You cannot pick that up.
> x bed
It is a queen sized bed, with a very firm mattress.
> s
Bathroom
You are in a bathroom built for workers in the cave.  There is a
urinal hanging on the wall, and some exposed pipes on the opposite
wall where a sink used to be.  To the north is a bedroom.
> x bed
I cannot see that here.
> x lklgfmlda
I cannot see that here.
> x urinal
The urinal is very clean compared with everything else in the cave.  There
isn't even any rust.  Upon close examination you realize that the drain at the
bottom is missing, and there is just a large hole leading down the
pipes into nowhere.  The hole is too small for a person to fit in.  The
flush handle is so clean that you can see your reflection in it.
>

Here, we see that some objects can be examined even though they cannot be
picked up. But we also see that they cannot be examined in the wrong room.
We also notice that the urinal's handle appears to be frequently used. Maybe
that's a clue that we should flush it:

> flush
Whoooosh!!

You have scored 0 points out of 90 possible points.
>

Oh. So this seems to be where we put our treasures. (The original game doesn't
print the score if you don't make points, but my way is easier and, I think,
better.) Well, let's give it a try then:

> put gold
You don't have that.
> i
You currently have:
A bracelet
A diamond
A floppy disk
A brass key
A slip of paper
A life preserver
A shovel
> put bracelet
You must supply an indirect object.
> put bracelet in
You must supply an indirect object.
> put bracelet gold
You must supply an indirect object.
> put bracelet in gold
that indirect object is not here.
> put bracelet in key
I don't know how to combine those objects. Perhaps you should
just try dropping it.
> put bracelet in urinal
You hear it plop down in some water below.
>

In the above, we see how the put command works, and what error messages it
gives in different situations. Now, at this point, we have put the bracelet
(which we suspect is a treasure, into the place that we suspect we are meant
to put treasures. So let's see what happens when we flush:

> flush
Whoooosh!!

You have scored 10 points out of 90 possible points.
> i
You currently have:
A diamond
A floppy disk
A brass key
A slip of paper
A life preserver
A shovel
>

Yep, that is the function of the urinal. Each treasure is worth 10 points. But
you only get the points when you flush the urinal.

Well, let's try some more things with the urinal:
> n
Bedroom
> put paper in urinal
that indirect object is not here.
> s
Bathroom
> put paper in urinal
You hear it plop down in some water below.
> put disk in urinal
You hear it plop down in some water below.
> put life sdfsdfdsfsdfvvfdbfdb urinal  sddfsdfdsf rgrgrgr grg 
You hear it plop down in some water below.
> i
You currently have:
A diamond
A brass key
A shovel
> flush
Whoooosh!!

You have scored 10 points out of 90 possible points.
>

From the above, we see that these items are not treasures, and they give us no
points. (The actual treasures are: bracelet, diamond, gold, and platinum.)
We also see that objects are unrecoverable once they are dropped in the 
urinal -- that is, even if you haven't flushed it yet. This is just like the
actual game.

We also see that "put life sdfsdfdsfsdfvvfdbfdb urinal  sddfsdfdsf rgrgrgr grg"
works just as well as "put life in urinal". This is because the original game
doesn't check the third argument or care if there are extra arguments.

Now, in the above walkthrough, we've ruined our game, because we need the
floppy disk. So let's restart:

> quit
You have scored 10 points out of 90 possible points.
$ source pa3.sh
$ game
Misty Room
You are in a misty, humid room carved into a mountain.
To the north is the remains of a rockslide.  To the east, a small
passage leads away into the darkness.
Here there is:
A gold bar
> score
You have scored 0 points out of 90 possible points.
>

Notice that the "quit" command displays the score and also changes the prompt
(among other things). The "score" command on the other hand, just displays the
score.

Well, now, let's not waste the time of walking through the game. let's instead
take a short cut to go to where I know that we can find the passcode for the
door.

> cd ~/pa3/start/e/e/n/d/d/sw/w/d/e/.d/s/s/s
> look
PC area
You have reached a dead end.  There is a PC on the floor here.  Above
it is a sign that reads:
          Type the reset command to type on the PC.
A hole leads north.
> x pc
It is a personal computer that has only one floppy disk drive.
> x drive
It is a personal computer that has only one floppy disk drive.
> reset
Boot sector not found
>

There is a PC in this room. But it seems to be broken. Actually, if you were
old enough to have used an old PC, then you would understand what "boot sector"
means. It means that the PC doesn't have a hard drive; it needs a floppy disk
to boot from. Fortunately, we have a floppy:

> put bracelet in drive
You can't put that in the PC!
> put floppy in ibm
> i
You currently have:
A bracelet
A diamond
A brass key
A slip of paper
A life preserver
A shovel
> look
PC area
You have reached a dead end.  There is a PC on the floor here.  Above
it is a sign that reads:
          Type the reset command to type on the PC.
A hole leads north.
>

From this, we see that only the floppy/disk can be put into the PC/ibm/drive.
When it is put into the PC, then the floppy is gone (just like in the real
game). But maybe "reset" will work now:

> reset
Current time is 3:20:45
Enter new time:

What is this? Well, it's waiting for you to type a new time. This is how these
old PCs were. Everyone would just hit enter. In fact, you can type anything and
the game will accept it:

> reset
Current time is 3:20:45
Enter new time: gfdgdfg
A>

Now, something else needs to be noticed. The current time is actually the real
current time of your system. (It was 3:20:45 in the afternoon when I wrote ran
this.) So we now have a PC prompt. What can we do with that?

A> fgfdgf
Bad command or file name
A> ls
Bad command or file name
A>

It turns out that we can't do much without knowing dos commands. Dos is not
unix; instead of "ls", dos uses "dir":

A> dir

 Volume in drive A is FOO
 Volume Serial Number is 1A16-08C9
 Directory of A:\

COMMAND  COM     47845 04-09-91   2:00a
FOO      TXT        40 01-20-93   1:01a
        2 file(s)      47845 bytes
                     1065280 bytes free

A>

So, there are two files stored on the floppy disk. I wonder what we can do with
them?

A> command.com
Bad command or file name
A> cat command.com
Bad command or file name
A> type command.com
Cannot type binary files
A>

Well, now we are getting somewhere. "Type" is the dos equivalent of unix of
"cat". Command.com is a binary file, but foo.txt isn't. Let's see:

A> type foo.txt

The combination is 869.
A>

OK. So now we have the passcode. Notice also that dos isn't case sensitive.
So, how can we finish, now that we have what we want? Use "exit":

A> exit

You power down the machine and step back.

The box has a slit in the top of it, and on it, in sloppy handwriting, is
written: 'For key upgrade, put key in here.'
> put gold in box
You don't have that.

You can't put that in the key box!

As you drop the key, the box begins to shake. Finally it explodes
with a bang. The key seems to have vanished!

Well, the key is gone. (The upgraded key would reappear, if we implemented the
next level of the game.) The box is gone too. Let's keep going:

You are at the continuation of an up/down staircase.

You are at the top of a staircase leading down.  A crawlway leads off

Small crawlspace
You are in a small crawlspace.  There is a hole in the ground here, and
a small passage back to the southwest.
Here there is:
An axe

You pick up the axe

N/S/W Junction
You are at the junction of two passages. One goes north/south, and
the other goes west.
> n
North end of cave passage
You are at the north end of a north/south passageway.  There are stairs
leading down from here.  There is also a door leading west.
>

OK. So we found our way back to the locked room. (And we have the axe, which
we'll need in this room.) But let's drop the axe first, and see what happens:

> drop axe
Dropped.
> w
You must type a 3 digit combination code to enter this room.
Enter it here: 869

You are in the Gamma Computing Center.  An IBM 3090/600s is whirring
away in here.  There is an ethernet cable coming out of one of the units,
and going through the ceiling.  There is no console here on which you
could type.
> x cable
I see nothing special about that.
> x computer
I see nothing special about that.
> cut cable
You have nothing with which to break things.
>

Oh. So we need the axe (the shovel doesn't cut it). Let's go get the axe:
> e
North end of cave passage
Here there is:
An axe
> get axe
You pick up the axe
> w

See that the door has been reshut and so it had to be passcoded again. Now
let's finish the game:

> cut cable with fdgfhfgh
As you break the ethernet cable, everything starts to blur. You collapse
for a moment, then straighten yourself up.

Connection closed.

Congratulations. You finished the level. Now, type "quit" to finish.
> quit
You have scored 0 points out of 90 possible points.
$

Notice that we didn't need to say "cut cable with axe". The game only looks for
"cut cable". Everything else is ignored.

OK, now. Let's look at something else about cut:

In the above, we see that the axe cannot be used on objects that aren't
present. If, however, you use it on an object that is present, the axe is
destroyed, rather than the thing you use it on. This is, oddly, how the
original game works. 

There is one more thing to consider. The red room has a hole hidden by a towel:



Let us think some more about prepositions:

So, once we get the towel, the hole is revealed. And it has to indicate its
presence, even when re-entering the room. We cannot go down until the hole is
revealed. That is why line 522 above had said:
> cd e/e/n/d/d/sw/w/d/e/.d/n/n/u/u/u/ne/ne/

Notice the ".d" in this path. Since we were jumping ahead to the place where
the axe was, we had not picked up the towel. So the down directory was still
hidden.
But the pwd back on line 654 gave "/home/user/pa3/start/e/e/n/d/d/sw/w/d/e/d"
Notice that the final directory in this path is "d", not ".d". This is because
we really went down the hole, after removing the towel.

Let's also notice that the directory tree of the rooms has a little difference:

$ ls ~/pa3
holdkey  holdtreasure  items  start  treasures
$

The above five items are all directories. Their meanings are:
  holdkey: This directory is used for only one purpose. Holding the key if it
           is put in the box (so that level 4 could retrieve it, in theory).
  holdtreasure: This is where items go when they are put in the urinal.
  items: This has the same meaning as it had in the previous homework.
  start: This has the same meaning as it had in the previous homework.
  treasures: This is where items from holdtreasure go when you flush.

And there you have it. That is the walkthrough.
