As soon as you start to doze off you begin dreaming.  You see images of
workers digging caves, slaving in the humid heat.  Then you see yourself
as one of these workers.  While no one is looking, you leave the group
and walk into a room.  The room is bare except for a horseshoe
shaped piece of stone in the center.  You see yourself digging a hole in
the ground, then putting some kind of treasure in it, and filling the hole
with dirt again.  After this, you immediately wake up.
